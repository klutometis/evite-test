Running the tests:

    Run run-tests.sh, which starts the server and runs nosetests.

Purpose:

    Create a scheduler that allows 'Events' to be scheduled for repeated sending.Ê			

Details:

    The Scheduler and Server take a function that should perform the actual 'Sending'.
    The sender function has the following signature:
        
        def sender(recpt, msg):
            pass

    This should be called once per rcpt per interval.

    The tests in test_service.py should test all of this functionality.
    Pass as many tests as you can in the amount of time you are willing to devote.

Things to do:

    1) Make a basic RESTful events service that persists.
       * It takes json and hands back json.
       * The event has these things: msg, recipients (emails), start, interval, repeat
    2) Make a Scheduler that sends these events out to the recipients given the start, interval and repeat.
